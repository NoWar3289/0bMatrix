# 0bMatrix

A simple python terminal animation that mimics the matrix digital glitch effect using colored binary digits (`0` and `1`). It creates a visually appealing stream of 0s and 1s using ANSI colors and runs continuously.

2. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NoWar3289/0bMatrix.git

   ```
4. **Run it:**

## Notes

* Works best in small-sized terminal windows
* To exit the animation, close the terminal window manually or Press `Ctrl + C`
